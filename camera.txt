Q:When I finish the steps to add the camera to the CMS list,why it notify “ Can’t find the Device “  even I can see the default ip address 192.168.1.10 in the menu .

F: It is the IP Address conflict ,the default ip address is not in the same network segment as your router.

Please click “Edit Device “ to change the camera’s ip address to make them in the same network segment !

For example ,if your router’s ip address is 192.168.0.1 ,then you need to change the camera’s ip address to 192.168.0.XX .
